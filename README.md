# NitroNLP
Explore the NitroNLP repository, showcasing our team's achievement of securing the 6th position. Our focus was text classification, and our journey was marked by key milestones. We began with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset better, setting the stage for informed decisions.

We experimented with classic tools like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and XGBoost to fine-tune our approach. As we aimed for higher accuracy, we transitioned to transformer-encoders. mBert, roBert, and xlmRoberta emerged as formidable allies, handling intricate text data with finesse.

This repository encapsulates our collaborative efforts, highlighting the path we took to success. Whether you're a fellow team member, a curious learner, or a text classification enthusiast, our repository offers insights into EDA, traditional methods, and the transformative influence of advanced transformer models. Join us in reliving the NitroNLP journey that led to our remarkable 6th place accomplishment.
